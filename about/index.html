title: About Gavin Donnelly

		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a enthusiastic software engineer, studied at Strathclyde
        University. Originally from Glasgow Scotland. I previously took a year
        out of my studies on a work placement with Flextronics in Cork, Ireland.
        I am now looking for where my next adventure will take me. I have a love
        for all areas of computing and technology, with a passion for developing
        the best software solutions possible. 

        In my studies and experience in the work place, I have an eagerness for
        learning and feel that everyday is a new experience from which something
        great can always be taken. I am very flexible in my coding platforms and
        have large range of programming languages which I have expert skills in.
        I think one of the main things lacking in software world today is a knowledge
        of computer science fundamentals. I have those fundamentals and bring them
        into my work, at the foundation of every project.

        I have a weakness for films and I'm avid movie goer. With a large knowledge
        of miscellaneous film facts along with a vast film library.
        I love to travel, I have been fortunate enough to see a lot of the world
        already and wish to keep that trend going.

        I am keen to connect with like-minded people so please feel free to
        reach out to me.</p>
