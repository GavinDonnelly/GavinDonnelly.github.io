Well. Finally got around to putting this website together. I had a website before but I never really got round to creating what I wanted from it. This time around I will. It will just be pages for things about me and my code. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
